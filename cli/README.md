blazecli
========

- [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

**blazecli** is a command line interface for the
[**blazesym**][blazesym] library. It aims to closely mirror the
structure of the library in its command and sub-command structure.


Usage
-----
As mentioned above, the program's sub-command aim to mirror the
library's public API structure. Hence, to symbolize an address in an ELF
file -- which **blazesym** allows via the
[`symbolize::Symbolizer`][blazesym-sym] type in conjunction with the
[`Elf` source][blazesym-elf-src] -- is possible via the `symbolize elf`
sub-command:

```sh
# Just an example to illustrate symbolization on live data.
$ readelf --syms /lib64/libc.so.6 --wide | grep readdir64_r
>   2253: 00000000000caee0   228 FUNC    WEAK   DEFAULT   12 readdir64_r@@GLIBC_2.2.5

$ blazecli symbolize elf --path /lib64/libc.so.6 00000000000caee0
> 0xcaee0: readdir_r@0xcaee0+0 :0
```

To run the program from within a checkout (without any kind of
installation), you would use:
```sh
$ cargo run -p blazecli -- symbolize elf --path /lib64/libc.so.6 00000000000caee0
```

Similarly, to symbolize an address inside a process the `symbolize
process` sub-command can be used. Please refer to the program's help
text for additional details.


### Shell Completion
**blazecli** comes with shell completion support (for various shells). A
completion script can be generated via the `shell-complete` utility
program and then only needs to be sourced to make the current shell
provide context-sensitive tab completion support. E.g.,
```bash
$ cargo run -p blazecli --bin=shell-complete --features="clap_complete" -- bash > blazecli.bash
$ source blazecli.bash
```

The generated completion script can be installed system-wide and sourced
through initialization files, such as `~/.bashrc`.

Completion scripts for other shells work in a similar manner. Please
refer to the help text (`--help`) of the `shell-complete` program for
the list of supported shells.
